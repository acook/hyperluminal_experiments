Hyperluminal Experiments
========================

Hyperluminal is a theoretical programming language, this is an exploration in semantics.

One way of experiementing with the language is to translate the semantics into an existing language as closely as possible.

Another is to write similar semantics with multiple syntaxes to explore the best representation of the concepts.

Note
----

You won't find the alternative (ie non-hyperluminal) languages to be idiomatic, since they are designed to match the hyperluminal semantics as closely as possible. However, feel free to contribute additional alternative versions that are more idiomatic.
