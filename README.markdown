Hyperluminal Experiments
========================

Hyperluminal is a theoretical programming language, this is an exploration in semantics.

One way of experiementing with the language is to translate the semantics into an existing language as closely as possible.

Another is to write similar semantics with multiple syntaxes to explore the best representation of the concepts.

The Experiments
---------------

Each subdirectory contains its own readme and collections of various files.

GitHub automatically displays files named "README*" so just click on the directory you're curious about the readme will automatically be displayed along with the files.

Kind of like an old BBS/DOS system with desc and nfo files come to think of it..

Disclaimer
----------

You won't find the alternative (ie non-hyperluminal) languages to be idiomatic, since they are designed to match the hyperluminal semantics as closely as possible. However, feel free to contribute additional alternative versions that are more idiomatic.
