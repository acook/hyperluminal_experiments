Hyperluminal Experiments
========================

Hyperluminal is a theoretical programming language, this is an exploration in semantics.

One way of experiementing with the language is to translate the semantics into an existing language as closely as possible.

Another is to write similar semantics with multiple syntaxes to explore the best representation of the concepts.
